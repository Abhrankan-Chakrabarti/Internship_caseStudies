# Winternship 2025 Case Studies – Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solved lessons from the **Winternship 2025 Case Studies**.  
This repo showcases my progress in mastering modern web development concepts through practical, hands-on challenges across **TypeScript**, **React (Vite)**, and **MongoDB** (with Express coming next).

---

## 📘 Overview
The Winternship 2025 program provides structured case studies across:
- **TypeScript** → mastering language fundamentals, advanced types, generics, and design patterns  
- **React (Vite)** → building interactive UIs with hooks, state management, and component-driven architecture  
- **MongoDB** → designing aggregation pipelines for analytics and data transformation  
- **Express** → upcoming lessons on backend routing, middleware, and REST APIs  

Each case study bridges theory and practice with real-world coding exercises.

## 🚀 What’s Inside
- **CaseStudy1 (TypeScript)**  
  - Functions (optional, default, rest parameters, callbacks, recursion, overloads)  
  - Advanced Types (union, utility, mapped types)  
  - Generics (generic classes and functions)  
  - Design Patterns (Observer, Strategy)  
  - Classes & Access Modifiers (inheritance, private/protected members)  

- **react/**  
  - Vite-based React app (`my-react-app`)  
  - Component-driven solutions with hooks  
  - State management patterns  
  - Code-splitting and optimization  

- **mongodb/**  
  - Aggregation pipelines using `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, `$sort`, `$limit`  
  - Case study: MovieFlix analytics (views, ratings, genres)  
  - Scripts runnable via `mongosh` or Node.js driver

## 🛠️ How to Run
Clone the repo and run any case study:

### TypeScript
```bash
cd Internship_caseStudies/CaseStudy1
tsc lesson-name.ts
node lesson-name.js
```

### React (Vite)
```bash
cd Internship_caseStudies/react/my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite dev server and open the app in your browser.

### MongoDB
```bash
cd Internship_caseStudies/mongodb
npm install
node solution.js
```

## 📈 Progress Tracker
- [x] **TypeScript**: Functions, Advanced Types, Generics, Design Patterns (Observer + Strategy), Classes & Access Modifiers  
- [x] **React (Vite)**: Component-driven solutions, hooks, state management  
- [x] **MongoDB**: Aggregation pipeline case study (MovieFlix analytics)  
- [ ] **Express**: Backend routing & middleware (upcoming)  

---

## ✨ Highlights
- Strong focus on **clarity and modularity**.  
- Each solution includes **conceptual explanation + runnable code**.  
- Demonstrates growth across **frontend, backend, and database layers** of the MERN stack.
