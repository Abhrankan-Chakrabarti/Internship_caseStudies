# Winternship 2025 Case Studies – TypeScript Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solved lessons from the **Winternship 2025 Case Studies**.  
This repo showcases my progress in mastering modern web development concepts, especially **TypeScript**, through practical, hands-on challenges.

---

## 📘 Overview
The Winternship 2025 program provides structured case studies across:
- TypeScript
- React
- MongoDB
- Express

Each lesson bridges theory and practice with real-world coding exercises.  
Here, I’ve implemented and tested solutions for multiple TypeScript lessons, including:
- Functions (optional, default, rest parameters, callbacks, recursion, overloads)
- Advanced Types (union, utility, mapped types)
- Generics (generic classes and functions)
- Design Patterns (Observer, Strategy)
- Classes & Access Modifiers (inheritance, private/protected members)

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside
- **Lesson files**: Each `.ts` file corresponds to a solved challenge.
- **Runnable demos**: Code is self-contained and can be executed with `ts-node` or compiled with `tsc`.
- **Examples included**: Console outputs demonstrate expected behavior.

## 🛠️ How to Run
Clone the repo and run any lesson file:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhrankan-Chakrabarti/Internship_caseStudies.git
cd Internship_caseStudies/CaseStudy1
tsc lesson-name.ts
node lesson-name.js
```
